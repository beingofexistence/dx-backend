## Installation

To install **dx-backend**, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [here](^1^).

Then, you can clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-backend.git
```

Next, you need to install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

To use **dx-backend**, you need to create a configuration file that specifies the database settings, the request routes, and the communication options. You can find an example of a configuration file in the `config` folder.

Then, you can use the `dx` object to access the features of **dx-backend**. For example, you can use the following code to create a database connection:

```javascript
const dx = require('dx-backend');

dx.connectDB(config.db); // config.db is the database settings
```

You can use the following code to handle a GET request:

```javascript
dx.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // req is the request object
  // res is the response object

  // get all users from the database
  dx.find('users', {}, (err, users) => {
    // err is the error object
    // users is the array of users

    if (err) {
      // send an error response
      res.status(500).send(err);
    } else {
      // send a success response with users as JSON
      res.status(200).json(users);
    }
  });
});
```

You can use the following code to communicate with the frontend using WebSocket:

```javascript
dx.ws('/chat', (socket) => {
  // socket is the WebSocket object

  // listen for messages from the frontend
  socket.on('message', (msg) => {
    // msg is the message object

    // send a message back to the frontend
    socket.send(msg);
  });
});
```
